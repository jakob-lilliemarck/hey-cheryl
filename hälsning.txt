Hey Cheryl,

Thank you for your inspiring and insightful perspective, and for your ever-enthusiastic spirit. I've learned so much from you!

You're leaving a void of knowledge behind at Konstfack, and though it may seem naive, I wanted to honor you by attempting to amend that. After all, what better way to celebrate your lifelong career of academic excellence than by creatively exploring and learning about something new?

As such, I present to you Hey-Cheryl a faint and quirky digital echo of our beloved professor.
